The decision variables of each individual are set up for minimization with gray coding. Each individual is assigned a random 10-bit string when initialized. A population of 25 individuals is created and each are evaluated to determine their fitness. The evaluation function converts the gray code to real values within the range [-4, 4]. Then calculates and returns f1 and f2.
